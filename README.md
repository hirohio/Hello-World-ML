# Hello-World-ML
This project is a CUI application for ML.

Mchine Learning is uesd for many filelds.
However, if users want to use ML, they have to learn Programming in advance, or use GUI application.
Learning Programming is difficult for most of users and GUI Application is not good performance(e.g, MS Excel is too large.).

This project is a CUI application and supplies fundamental functions as follows.

1, Preprocessing.
2, ML Algorithm
3, Drawing Graphs.
4, Write/Read csv file.

I believe that it helps some beginner programmer and non programmer who wan to use ML.
