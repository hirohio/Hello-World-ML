# Hello-World-ML
Objective of this project is developing a CUI application for ML.

Mchine Learning is used for many fields.
However, if users want to use ML, they have to learn Programming in advance, or use GUI application.
Learning Programming is difficult for most of users and GUI Applications have performance trouble(e.g, MS Excel takes time to be executed.).

Objective of this project is developing a CUI application which has fundamental functions as follows.

1, Preprocessing.
2, ML Algorithm
3, Drawing Graphs.
4, Write/Read csv file.

I believe that it helps some beginner programmer and non programmer who wan to use ML.
